# Testing TypeScript with Node

## Benefits of TypeScript

As we already discussed, TypeScript is a superset of Javascript. It gives you the following benefits:

- optional static typing, with emphasis on optional (it makes porting JavaScript application to TypeScript easy),
- as a developer, you can start using ECMAScript features that are not supported by the current V8 engine by 
using build targets,
- use of interfaces,
- great tooling with instruments like IntelliSense.


## Installing TypeScript

    npm install -g typescript
    
## Compiling .ts code to .js
